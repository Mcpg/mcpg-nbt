# mcpg-nbt
mcpg-nbt is an simple NBT library, made for me. That's it.

## Building library JAR file
Download, or clone this repo, download Maven if you don't have
it installed, go to the root of the project using terminal/cmd/whatever
and execute `mvn install`. In `target` folder file `mcpg-nbt-1.0.jar`
should appear.

## Maven
